            </div>

            <div class="overview-box">
                <p>
                    This page describes how I introduced an Event-Driven Architecture using Spring Application Events and a Transactional Outbox pattern to decouple user-facing point transactions from an external settlement system, ensuring that settlement failures do not impact user experience.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Point settlement was previously handled entirely within the internal system.</li>
                    <li>To increase point usage and support more redemption channels, integration with a licensed external settlement provider became necessary.</li>
                    <li>It was critical to decouple user-facing point transactions from the settlement process to prevent external failures from affecting user experience.</li>
                    <li>A Transactional Outbox pattern was adopted to enable reliable asynchronous processing.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="stats-box">
                    <h4>Daily Transaction Volume</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>KT: approximately 60–70K events/day</li>
                        <li>SKT: approximately 20–30K events/day</li>
                        <li>LG: approximately 20–30K events/day</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Although a message broker such as Kafka was considered, the operational complexity and cost in a restricted, no-internet environment outweighed the benefits at this scale.
                        A DB-backed outbox pattern with batch processing was therefore chosen as the most practical solution.
                    </p>

                <h2>Architecture Summary</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decoupled user point transactions from the external settlement system using an event-driven approach.</li>
                    <li>Published domain events using Spring <code>publishEvent</code>.</li>
                    <li>Consumed events via <code>eventListener</code> and persisted them in a transactional outbox table.</li>
                    <li>Processed outbox events asynchronously through batch jobs to invoke the external settlement API.</li>
                    <li>Implemented retry and failure-handling strategies to isolate external system issues from user-facing flows.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Key Points</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spring <code>publishEvent</code> / <code>eventListener</code></li>
                        <li>Transactional Outbox Pattern</li>
                        <li>Asynchronous batch polling</li>
                        <li>Decoupling of user-facing transactions and external integration logic</li>
                        <li>Retry and failure-handling strategy for external API calls</li>
                        <li>Sequential ordering guarantees for settlement requests</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
                <h3>1. Ordering Guarantee Issue for Settlement Requests</h3>
                
                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Outbox events were initially processed in order of creation time.</li>
                        <li>The timestamp column stored values only up to second-level precision (<code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss</code>).</li>
                        <li>When multiple events were created within the same second, their processing order could not be guaranteed.</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduced an auto-increment <code>seq</code> column.</li>
                        <li>Sorted events by this sequence value to ensure deterministic processing order.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>2. Point Expiration Timing Mismatch</h3>

                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>External settlement provider expired points between 00:03 and 00:10.</li>
                        <li>The internal service executed point expiration at 00:02.</li>
                        <li>This timing mismatch caused temporary balance inconsistencies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Redesigned the retry strategy.</li>
                        <li>Gradually increased retry intervals based on <code>RETRY_COUNT</code>, from 5 seconds up to 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Improved handling logic to absorb temporary inconsistencies caused by timing differences.</li>
                    </ul>
