                    This page highlights real production issues I personally identified, analyzed, and resolved while operating large-scale financial and point systems.
                    Rather than reacting only to reported incidents, I proactively investigated system behavior, performance metrics, and data inconsistencies to uncover hidden problems.

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Withdrawal fee calculations were applied at a different timing than balance validation, causing user confusion and inconsistent results.</li>
                    <li> Expired point statistics were calculated based on data insertion dates, which did not reflect the actual expiration execution dates.</li>
                    <li> Monthly expiration reports lacked visibility into daily point expiration trends.</li>
                    <li> User point earnings and usage were not traceable, making it impossible to accurately identify where points were earned, how they were spent, or reconcile balances by date.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Solutions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Refined withdrawal validation logic to align fee calculation timing with available balance checks.
                    <li> Introduced daily point expiration batches and reporting to replace coarse monthly statistics.</li>
                    <li> Redefined expiration query criteria to reflect the actual expiration execution window.</li>
                    <li> Implemented explicit earned–spent–expired mappings to enable accurate settlement tracking and historical reconciliation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Improved accuracy and predictability of withdrawal validation and settlement reports.</li>
                        <li> Reduced reconciliation discrepancies when integrating with external settlement systems.</li>
                        <li> Increased internal trust in financial data consistency and auditability.</li>
                    </ul>
